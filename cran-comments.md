This is ggRandomForests package submission v2.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Correct a bug in survival plots when predicting on future data without a known outcome.
* ALL Vignettes are now at https://github.com/ehrlinger/ggRFVignette
* All tests are being moved to https://github.com/ehrlinger/ggRFVignette
* Begin work on rewriting all checks to not use cached data. 
  This will require more runtime, and hence we will run fewer of them on CRAN release. 
* Minor bug and documentation fixes.
