\title{ggRandomForests package for plotting of random forest objects using
the \code{ggplot2} package.}
\description{
ggRandomForests is an add on package for \code{randomForestSRC}.
The package is designed to simplify the graphical analysis and exploration
of randomForests.

The randomForestSRC package provides a unified treatment of Breimans random
forests (Breiman 2001) for a variety of data settings. Regression and
classification forests are grown when the response is numeric or categorical
(factor) while survival and competing risk forests (Ishwaran et al. 2008, 2012)
are grown for right-censored survival data. Support for unsupervised and
multivariate randomForests have also recently been added.

Many of the features of the ggRandomForests package are available
within the randomForestSRC package. However, the ggRandomForests offers the
following advantages:
\itemize{
\item Separation of data and figures: ggRandomForest contains functions that
operate on either the raw randomForestSRC (rfsrc) forest object directly, or on
the output from rfsrc posprocessing functions (i.e. \code{vimp.rfsrc},
\code{var.select.rfsrc}, \code{plot.variable.rfsrc}) to generate intermediate
data.frame objects. These objects are then passed to corresponding plot functions
using the S3 object model. Alternatively, the user can use these data object for
additional external, custom plotting or analysis operations.


\item \code{ggplot2} figures: We chose to use the \code{ggplot2} package for our figures.
 The plot functions all return either a single \code{ggplot2} object, or a \code{list} of
 \code{ggplot2} objects.
 The user can then use additional \code{ggplot2} functions to modify and customise the
 figures to their liking.
}

The ggRandomForests package contains the following functions:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{gg_rfsrc}}: randomForest[SRC] prediction
\item \code{\link{gg_error}}: randomForest[SRC] convergence rate based on the OOB error rate.
\item \code{\link{gg_roc}}: ROC curves for randomForest classification models.
\item \code{\link{gg_vimp}}: Variable Importance ranking for variable selection
\item \code{\link{gg_minimal_depth}}: Minimal Depth ranking for variable selection
\item \code{\link{gg_interaction}}: Minimal Depth interaction detection (under development)
\item \code{\link{gg_variable}}: Marginal variable dependence (including conditional dependence)
\item \code{\link{gg_partial}}: Partial variable dependence  (including conditional partial dependence)
\item \code{\link{gg_survival}}: Non-parameteric Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalon survival estimates
}

All functions have an associated plotting function that returns ggplot2 graphics, either
individually or as a list, that can be further customised using standard ggplot2 commands.
